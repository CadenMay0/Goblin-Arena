HOW TO PLAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start, click on a goblin fighter from the pool of four goblins.
Once you've picked your champion the next step is to choose an opponent by clicking on one of the goblins that's moved rows.
With your opponent picked it's time to battle. 
Keep pressing the attack button until your goblin either KO's the opponent or dies trying.
If you ko the opponent then you move on to select the next goblin opponent.
If you get killed then it's game over for you and you have to restart.
Once you've defeated all the enemy goblins, congratulations! You've won!
